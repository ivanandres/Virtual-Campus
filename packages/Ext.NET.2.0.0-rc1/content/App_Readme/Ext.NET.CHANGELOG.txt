1.   - XControl has been renamed to BaseControl
	 - StateManagedItem has been renamed to BaseItem
	 - StateManagedItemCollection has been renamed to BaseItemCollection


2.	 The IDMode="Explicit" functionality has been changed. 

	It still causes the control ClientID to be rendered if a developer explicitly set up the control ID.

	But ClientID doesn't match ID anymore, it is constructed in a common way.

	Use IDMode="Static" isntead.

3.	 Window .CloseAction "Close" has been renamed to "Destroy".

	 Example

	 <ext:Window runat="server" CloseAction="Close" />

	 // New
	 <ext:Window runat="server" CloseAction="Destroy" />

4.	 Panel .Padding property has been renamed to .BodyPadding. 

	 Example
	 
	 // Old
	 <ext:Window runat="server" Padding="5" />
	 
	 // New
	 <ext:Window runat="server" BodyPadding="5" />

	 The .Padding property is still available, although now renders as Padding around 
	 the Component, instead of padding in the Body of the Component.

	 All previous instance of .Padding should be renamed to .BodyPadding. 

5.	 The server Panel Border property type has been changed from bool to bool?.
	 The server Panel BodyBorder property type has been changed from bool to int?.

	 // New
	 <ext:AccordionLayout runat="server" AnimatePostion="false">

7.	 AfterRecordUpdatedEventArgs .NewValues has been renamed to .Values.
	 
	 Example

	 // Old
	 protected void Store1_RecordUpdated(object sender, AfterRecordUpdatedEventArgs e)
     {
         var company = new
         {
             Name = e.NewValues["company"],
             Price = e.NewValues["price"],
             LastChange = e.NewValues["lastChange"]
         };
     }

	 //New
	 protected void Store1_RecordUpdated(object sender, AfterRecordUpdatedEventArgs e)
     {
         var company = new
         {
             Name = e.Values["company"],
             Price = e.Values["price"],
             LastChange = e.Values["lastChange"]
         };
     }

	 Example

	 //Old
	 <ext:GridPanel runat="server" StripeRows="true">

             <ext:GridView runat="server" TrackOver="true" />
         </View>
     </ext:GridPanel>

	 Note

	 In according to ExtJS docs the default value is false. Now it's not. So, it needs to check it in the future.
	 Now is August'17.

10.	 GridPanel .AutoExpandColumn has been removed. To achieve the same effect use .Flex of Column.
	
	 Example

	 //Old
	 <ext:GridPanel runat="server" AutoExpandColumn="Company">

			 <Columns>
				 <ext:Column ColumnID="Company" ... />

			 <Columns>
				 <ext:Column Flex="1" ... />
			 </Columns>

	 Now use the public property .Mode which is defined in AbstractSelectionModel. The possible values are Single (default), Simple and Multi.

	 The default value of .SingleSelect is false: so, the equivalent is Mode="Multi" which is not default and should be set up explicitly.

	 //Old
	 <ext:RowSelectionModel runat="server">

	 //New
